# 🧩 Introduction

**Pi-hole Client** is an unofficial Android app for monitoring and managing
your own Pi-hole from your phone. It puts everyday admin tasks—checking stats,
pausing protection, browsing recent queries, and editing lists—into a fast,
mobile-first experience.

:::info

Not affiliated with the Pi-hole team. The app talks **directly** to your
Pi-hole; there’s no relay or third-party server.

## ✅ Supported versions

- **Pi-hole v6** — fully supported
- **Pi-hole v5** — supported as legacy

## 🏠 Access model (LAN-first)

This app is designed for **local network use**. In normal operation you use it **only on your LAN** (home Wi-Fi). We do **not** recommend exposing Pi-hole to the public Internet.

- Connect when your phone and Pi-hole are on the **same LAN/VPN**.
- **No port forwarding** needed.
- Use the Pi-hole **IP** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.2/`) or a resolvable hostname.
- If you must use it away from home, prefer a **VPN** (WireGuard/Tailscale). For HTTPS, use a trusted certificate.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Dashboard: queries today, blocked %, top domains/clients
- ⏯️ One-tap pause/resume (with timers)
- 🔎 Query log with rich filtering
- ✅/🚫 Allow/Block lists; update Adlists and apply changes
- 🖥️ Multiple servers with quick switching
- 🔐 HTTP/HTTPS (use HTTPS outside LAN)
- 🎨 Material You theming (Android 12+)

## 🧰 Requirements

- A reachable **Pi-hole v6 or v5** instance (same LAN, VPN, or a securely exposed endpoint)

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Install** from Google Play or download the latest release from GitHub.
2. **Add your server**
   - **v6:** enter the base URL and password → Save
   - **v5:** enter the base URL and your API key → Save

3. **Verify** the dashboard loads; try a 10-second pause to confirm control.

## 🔒 Privacy & crash reporting

- The app communicates **directly** with your Pi-hole.
- **Sentry reports are sent only when BOTH are true:**
  1. **Send diagnostics** is **ON**, **and**
  2. a **bug/crash** occurs.
- Sent: stack trace, app/OS version, device model, and minimal context.
- **Not intentionally sent:** Pi-hole API key, query contents, Adlists, personal data.
- You can turn reporting off anytime in **Settings → Privacy → Send diagnostics**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is an **unofficial** project and is not developed or supported by the
Pi-hole team. Configure remote access (VPN/HTTPS, auth) responsibly if you use
it outside your LAN.
