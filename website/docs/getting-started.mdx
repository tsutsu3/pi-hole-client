# ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to connect the app to your Pi-hole and start managing it
from your phone.

## 1. Install the app

You can get **Pi-hole Client** in one of two ways:

- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.tsutsu3.pi_hole_client) â€” easiest way to install and receive updates
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tsutsu3/pi-hole-client/releases) â€” for manual APK installation or testing newer builds

:::tip

For **Linux** or **Windows** users, see the [Installation Guide](../guides/installation)
for detailed setup instructions and dependency notes.

## 2. Prepare your Pi-hole

Before connecting:

- Make sure your **Pi-hole web interface is reachable** from your phone
  (same LAN, or via VPN like **WireGuard** / **Tailscale**).
- Confirm your Pi-hole version is **v6**:

  ```bash
  pihole -v
  ```

### For Pi-hole v6

- You'll need the **Web UI password** you set during installation.

### For Pi-hole v5

- Find your **API key** in`Settings â†’ API/Web interface â†’ Show API token`.
See [Getting the API token (v5 only)](../guides/get-api-token) for details.
