# 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to connect the app to your Pi-hole and start managing it
from your phone.

## 1. Install the app

You can get **Pi-hole Client** in one of two ways:

- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.tsutsu3.pi_hole_client) — easiest way to install and receive updates
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tsutsu3/pi-hole-client/releases) — for manual APK installation or testing newer builds

:::tip

For **Linux** or **Windows** users, see the [Installation Guide](../guides/installation)
for detailed setup instructions and dependency notes.

## 2. Prepare your Pi-hole

Before connecting:

- Make sure your **Pi-hole web interface is reachable** from your phone
  (same LAN, or via VPN like **WireGuard** / **Tailscale**).
- Confirm your Pi-hole version is **v6**:

  ```bash
  pihole -v
  ```

### For Pi-hole v6

- You'll need the **Web UI password** you set during installation.

### For Pi-hole v5

- Find your **API key** in`Settings → API/Web interface → Show API token`.
See [Getting the API token (v5 only)](../guides/get-api-token) for details.

## 3. Add your server in the app

Open **Settings → App Settings → Servers**, then tap **＋** to create a new
connection.

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "12px", flexWrap: "wrap"}}>
  <img width="240" alt="Servers list in App Settings" src={require('./user-manual/images/settings/app-settings/servers.png').default} />
  <img width="240" alt="Create a connection screen" src={require('./user-manual/images/settings/app-settings/create-a-connection.png').default} />
</div>

### Fill in the connection details

- **Server name**: a label shown in the app (for example, `Home Pi-hole`)
- **HTTP / HTTPS**:
  - Use **HTTP** for a local network setup
  - Use **HTTPS** if your Pi-hole is exposed through a reverse proxy or has TLS
- **Address**: your Pi-hole hostname or IP (for example, `pi.hole` or `192.168.1.10`)
- **Port** (optional): leave empty for the default (`80` for HTTP, `443` for HTTPS)

### Advanced options (only if needed)

- **Subroute** (optional): use this only when Pi-hole is served under a path by a
  reverse proxy (example: `/pihole`)
- **Allow self-signed certificates**: only available on **HTTPS**; enable it only
  if you intentionally use a self-signed certificate

### Select your Pi-hole version and authentication

- **Pi-hole v6 (recommended)**: enter your **Web UI password**
- **Pi-hole v5**: enter your **API token** (you can also scan it via QR code on mobile)

Tap **Connect** to verify the details and save the server.

If connection fails, double-check that the web interface is reachable from your
phone (LAN/VPN), and that the version and authentication match your Pi-hole.
For HTTPS, self-signed certificates, or reverse-proxy setups (subroutes), see
[Connecting to Your Pi-hole](../guides/create-a-connection).
