# 📊 Statistics

## What you can do on this screen

The Statistics screen helps you understand **where DNS traffic comes from** and
**what dominates it**. You mainly use it to:

- Identify domains, clients, or upstream servers that generate most traffic
- Jump directly to Logs filtered to a specific domain or client
- Compare trends across categories instead of checking only the current status

This screen is useful when something feels “known but unclear” and you want
context before taking action.

## Choose what you want to analyze

At the top of the screen, you see **four tabs** that switch between different
statistical views:

- **Queries & Servers** (default)
- **Domains**
- **Clients**
- **DNS** (Pi-hole v6 only)

When you open the Statistics screen, **Queries & Servers is selected by default**.
This view gives you a broad overview of total query volume and how traffic is
distributed across upstream servers.

Tap another tab to update both the chart and the ranked list below it.
The chart and the list always represent the same category.

Charts are visual only and cannot be tapped.
Use them to spot patterns, then rely on the list to take action.

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "12px", flexWrap: "wrap"}}>
  <img width="240" alt="Queries and servers chart" src={imgQueriesServersTop} />
  <img width="240" alt="Queries and servers list" src={imgQueriesServersBottom} />
</div>

Use **Queries & Servers** as a starting point when you are not yet sure
whether the issue is related to a domain, a client, or upstream routing.

If the **DNS** tab does not appear, the connected server is running **Pi-hole v5**.
This is expected behavior and does not indicate a connection problem.

## Read the chart first, then confirm with the list

After selecting a tab, start by looking at the chart.
It shows how traffic is distributed over time or across items.

Below the chart, a ranked list appears for the same category.
Each row represents one domain, client, or server, along with its percentage
of total queries.

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "12px", flexWrap: "wrap"}}>
  <img width="240" alt="Top domains list" src={imgDomainsTop} />
  <img width="240" alt="Bottom domains list" src={imgDomainsBottom} />
</div>

Use the chart to identify overall trends, then use the list to determine
**which specific item explains that trend**.

If the list is hidden or empty, Pi-hole privacy settings may be restricting
detailed data. In that case, avoid drawing strong conclusions from the chart
alone.

## Drill down into Logs from a list entry

Rows in the ranked list are tappable.

Tap a domain or client to open **Logs** with the corresponding filter
already applied. This allows you to inspect individual queries immediately,
without manually configuring filters.

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "12px", flexWrap: "wrap"}}>
  <img width="240" alt="Top clients statistics" src={imgClientsTop} />
  <img width="240" alt="Bottom clients list" src={imgClientsBottom} />
</div>

This workflow is useful when one entry dominates the list and you want to
confirm whether the traffic is expected or requires action.

## Inspect DNS metrics (Pi-hole v6 only)

On Pi-hole v6 servers, the **DNS** tab provides additional metrics such as
query types and DNS behavior.

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "12px", flexWrap: "wrap"}}>
  <img width="240" alt="DNS metrics statistics" src={imgDnsTop} />
  <img width="240" alt="Bottom DNS metrics list" src={imgDnsBottom} />
</div>

Use this view to confirm that DNS activity looks balanced and normal.
If the DNS tab is not visible, the connected server does not support
these metrics.

## Typical ways to use Statistics

- **Something feels slow**
  Open Statistics, switch to Domains or Clients, and check whether a single
  entry dominates the traffic.

- **Unexpected traffic spike**
  Use the chart to identify when it started, then tap the top list entry
  to inspect related queries in Logs.

- **Server-level investigation**
  Start with Queries & Servers to understand upstream routing behavior
  before narrowing the scope.

## Important notes and limits

- Charts are visual only and cannot be tapped.
- Ranked lists may be hidden by Pi-hole privacy settings.
- The DNS tab appears only on Pi-hole v6 servers.
- Statistics are aggregated and may lag slightly behind real time.

## Pi-hole concepts used on this screen

Statistics are based on **DNS queries** processed by Pi-hole.
Percentages indicate how much each domain, client, or server contributes
to the total traffic volume. Tapping a list entry applies the same filtering
logic used in Logs, but with fewer steps.
