# 🛡️ Domains

## What you can do on this screen

The Domains screen is where you **explicitly allow or block domains** in Pi-hole.
You mainly use it to:

- Allow a domain that should not be blocked
- Block a domain you do not want on your network
- Review, edit, disable, or remove existing rules

This screen is typically used after you have confirmed behavior in Logs
and want to apply a persistent rule.

---

## View and switch between allow and block rules

At the top of the screen, you see two tabs that separate domain rules by type:

- **Whitelist** - domains that are always allowed
- **Blacklist** - domains that are always blocked

Tap a tab to switch the list below it.
The list immediately updates to show only rules of the selected type.

<img width="320" alt="Domains list" src={imgDomains} />

Each row represents a single domain rule.
Use this list to quickly confirm whether a domain is already allowed or blocked
before adding a new rule.

Tap a row to open its detail view.

## Add a new domain rule

To create a new rule, tap the floating **＋** button in the bottom-right corner.

<img width="320" alt="Add domain dialog" src={imgDomainAdd} />

In the add dialog:

1. Choose whether the rule is **Allow** or **Block**
2. Enter the domain name
3. Tap **Add** to save

The list refreshes automatically after the rule is created.

Add a rule when a website or app consistently breaks due to blocking,
or when you want to permanently block a known unwanted domain.

Avoid using wildcard domains unless you intentionally want to match
all subdomains, as this can affect more traffic than expected.

## Review and manage an existing rule

Tap any domain in the list to open its detail screen.

<img width="320" alt="Domain details" src={imgDomainDetail} />

On this screen, you can:

- Review the domain and its rule type
- Temporarily disable the rule using the switch
- Permanently remove the rule using the delete action

Disabling a rule keeps it in Pi-hole but stops it from applying.
This is useful when testing whether a rule is still needed.

Deleting a rule removes it entirely and cannot be undone.
Only delete rules you are sure you no longer need.

## Typical ways to use Domains

- **A site is broken**
  Confirm the blocked domain in Logs, then add it to the Whitelist.

- **You want to block a specific service**
  Add the domain to the Blacklist to stop it consistently.

- **Cleaning up old rules**
  Review the list and disable rules before deleting them permanently.

## Important notes and limits

- Domain rules apply only to the currently selected server.
- Changes may take a short time to affect new queries.
- Overusing wildcard rules can cause unintended blocking or allowing.

## Pi-hole concepts used on this screen

A **domain rule** explicitly overrides Pi-hole’s default blocking behavior.
Whitelist rules always allow matching domains, while Blacklist rules always
block them. These rules are applied before gravity-based blocking and affect
future DNS queries immediately.
