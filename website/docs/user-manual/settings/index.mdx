# ⚙️ Settings

## What you can do on this screen

The Settings screen is where you configure **how the app behaves** and
**how it interacts with Pi-hole servers**. You mainly use it to:

- Customize app behavior such as theme, language, and server selection
- Manage Pi-hole server tools like Adlists (Subscriptions) and Groups & Clients
- View application and privacy information

This screen is not used frequently, but it becomes important during initial
setup, server changes, or maintenance.

## App Settings (top section)

At the top of Settings, you find [App Settings](./app-settings), which control how the
Pi-hole Client app itself behaves.
These settings affect only the app and do not change Pi-hole server behavior.

From here, you can open pages such as theme, language, and server management.

Use App Settings when you want to customize the app experience or manage
which Pi-hole servers are available.

## Server Settings (middle section)

Scrolling down reveals [Server Settings](./server-settings), which provide tools that directly
interact with the currently selected Pi-hole server.

In this section, you can manage Pi-hole configuration and data, including:

- **Server Info** - check server version, status, and basic details
- **Adlists** - manage subscription sources used by Pi-hole (allowlist and blocklist)
- **Groups & Clients** - organize clients and rules into groups
- **Advanced Setup** - access advanced server-side tools

All pages in this section operate on the **selected server only**.

:::info
These server-management tools are designed around the Pi-hole v6 API.
If you are connected to Pi-hole v5, some pages are replaced by an informational
message and should be managed from the Pi-hole web interface instead.

## About (bottom section)

At the bottom of Settings is the [About](./about) section.
These pages provide information about the app and its legal context and
do not affect app or server behavior.

<img width="320" alt="Settings screen bottom section" src={imgSettingsBottom} />

Here, you can open:

- **Application Detail** - app version and build information
- **Privacy** - privacy policy and diagnostics information
- **Legal** - legal notices and disclosures
- **Licenses** - open source licenses used by the app

Use this section when you need reference information rather than configuration.

## Typical ways to use Settings

- **First-time setup**
  Add a Pi-hole server, choose a theme, and set your preferred language.

- **Managing server configuration**
  Open Adlists or Groups to maintain blocking rules and client organization.

- **Checking app information**
  Use Application Detail or Privacy pages to review version and legal details.

## Important notes and limits

- Settings affect either the app or the currently selected server.
- Server tools depend on Pi-hole version and permissions.
- Changes to server configuration may take a short time to reflect in Logs
  and Statistics.

## Pi-hole concepts used on this screen

Settings expose both **app-level configuration** and **Pi-hole server tools**.
Server-related settings interact directly with Pi-hole’s APIs, while app
settings only affect local behavior such as appearance and language.
