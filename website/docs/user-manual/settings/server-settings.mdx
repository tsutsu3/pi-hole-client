# 🔧 Server Settings

## What you can do on this screen

Server Settings is where you manage **the currently selected Pi-hole server itself**.
Unlike App Settings, everything here affects server behavior and data.

Use this screen to:

- Confirm server identity, version, and health
- Maintain adlists, groups, and client assignments
- Perform advanced maintenance and network-related actions

:::info
Most tools on this screen are designed around the **Pi-hole v6 API**.
:::

---

## Server Info

Server Info shows **detailed information about the currently connected
Pi-hole server**.
Use this screen to confirm that the app is connected to the correct device
and to check the server’s current state.

<img width="320" alt="Server info screen" src={imgServerInfo} />

On this screen, you can confirm:

- **Server identity**
  - Server name
  - Hostname
  - Hardware model (for example, Raspberry Pi model)

- **Connection status**
  - Whether the server is currently reachable
  - Which server is selected as active

- **Performance**
  - Current CPU usage
  - Current memory (RAM) usage
    These values help you judge whether the server is under load.

- **Pi-hole versions**
  - Core version
  - FTL version
    Use these to confirm feature availability and compatibility
    (for example, v5 vs v6 differences).

Scroll down to reveal additional sections when you need more detail,
such as extended system or environment information.

<ImageRow>
  <img width="240" alt="Server info expanded top" src={imgServerInfoExpandTop} />
  <img width="240" alt="Server info expanded bottom" src={imgServerInfoExpandBottom} />
</ImageRow>

Always check Server Info before making changes in **Adlists**, **Groups & Clients**,
or **Advanced Setup**, to ensure you are operating on the intended Pi-hole server.

## Adlists

Adlists control which subscription lists Pi-hole uses to build its filtering
database (gravity). In Pi-hole v6, this includes both allowlist and blocklist
sources.

<img width="320" alt="Adlists screen" src={imgAdlists} />

### Add a list

Use **Add** to register a new subscription URL for the currently selected tab.

<img width="320" alt="Add adlist dialog" src={imgAdlistAdd} />

Only add lists from trusted sources.
Keep new lists enabled only after confirming they behave as expected.

### Review and manage lists

Tap a list to review its status and details.

<img width="320" alt="Adlist detail" src={imgAdlistDetail} />

Disable a list to pause its effect without losing configuration.
Delete a list only when you are sure it is no longer needed.

### Update Gravity

After adding or editing lists, use **Update Gravity** to rebuild the blocking
database.

<img width="320" alt="Update Gravity" src={imgUpdateGravity} />

This operation refreshes Pi-hole’s filtering database and may take a short time.

## Groups & Clients

Groups and Clients let you control **which rules apply to which devices**.
This is a Pi-hole v6 feature in the app.

<img width="320" alt="Groups list" src={imgGroups} />

### Groups

Groups define policy sets that can be assigned to clients.

Tap a group to edit its name or configuration.

<img width="320" alt="Group details" src={imgGroupDetails} />

Use **Add Group** to create a new group.

<img width="320" alt="Add group" src={imgAddGroup} />

Only create groups you intend to use, to keep policy management clear.

### Clients

Switch to the **Clients** tab to view devices known to the server.

<img width="320" alt="Clients list" src={imgClients} />

Tap a client to review its identity and group assignment.

<img width="320" alt="Client detail" src={imgClientDetail} />

Use **Add Clients** to manually register a device by IP, MAC, or name.

<img width="320" alt="Add clients" src={imgAddClients} />

Always confirm the device identity before assigning or changing groups.

---

## Advanced setup

Advanced Setup exposes **server-level maintenance and network tools**.
These actions directly affect Pi-hole behavior.

<img width="320" alt="Advanced server settings" src={imgAdvancedSettings} />

### Actions

- **Disable / Enable query logging**
  Temporarily stop logging DNS queries.
  Use only for short troubleshooting sessions.

- **Restart DNS resolver**
  Restart Pi-hole’s DNS service.
  This briefly interrupts DNS resolution.

- **Flush network table**
  Clear and rebuild device mappings.
  Useful after IP or hostname changes.

- **Flush logs (last 24 hours)**
  Remove recent query history.
  Avoid doing this if logs are still needed for analysis.

---

## Sessions

Sessions show active and recent DNS usage.

<img width="320" alt="Sessions list" src={imgSessions} />

Tap a session to view details.
If a session is currently in use, editing options may be limited.

<ImageRow>
  <img width="240" alt="Session detail" src={imgSessionDetail} />
  <img width="240" alt="Session in use" src={imgSessionDetailInUse} />
</ImageRow>

## DHCP

Use DHCP only if Pi-hole is acting as your DHCP server.

<ImageRow>
  <img width="240" alt="DHCP enabled" src={imgDhcp} />
  <img width="240" alt="DHCP disabled" src={imgDhcpOff} />
</ImageRow>

Tap a lease to review details and confirm IP assignments.

<img width="320" alt="DHCP lease detail" src={imgDhcpDetail} />

Keep DHCP disabled if another device already manages leases.

## Local DNS

Local DNS allows you to define custom hostnames inside your network.

<img width="320" alt="Local DNS list" src={imgLocalDns} />

Add entries when devices need stable, human-readable names.

<img width="320" alt="Add local DNS" src={imgLocalDnsAdd} />

Tap an entry to review or edit it.

<img width="320" alt="Local DNS detail" src={imgLocalDnsDetail} />

Avoid duplicate entries to prevent resolution conflicts.

---

## Find Domains In Lists

Find Domains In Lists lets you check **where a domain is defined** in Pi-hole.

<ImageRow>
  <img width="240" alt="Find domains in lists top" src={imgFindDomainsTop} />
  <img width="240" alt="Find domains in lists bottom" src={imgFindDomainsBottom} />
</ImageRow>

It searches across:

- **Domain-level lists** (Whitelist / Blacklist: exact + regex)
- **List-level lists** (Allowlist / Blocklist subscriptions: adlists)

### How to use

1. Enter a domain (example: `doubleclick.net`)
2. (Optional) Toggle **Use partial matching**
   - On (default): partial matches
   - Off: exact matches only
3. Set the max results (default: `20`)
4. Tap **Search** (it does not search while typing)

### Results and navigation

Results are split into sections.

- **Domain-level lists**: tap an entry to open **Domain detail**
- **List-level lists**: results are grouped by adlist; tap a card to open **Adlist detail**
  (Matching entries can be expanded; the list is scrollable)

If nothing matches, the screen shows **No results found**.
Changes made in the detail screens are reflected when you return.

## Interface

Interface shows which network interface Pi-hole is using.

<img width="320" alt="Interface overview" src={imgInterface} />

Review address details to confirm IP configuration.

<img width="320" alt="Interface address" src={imgInterfaceAddress} />

Statistics help verify whether traffic is flowing as expected.

<img width="320" alt="Interface statistics" src={imgInterfaceStats} />

Use detailed views only when troubleshooting connectivity issues.

<img width="320" alt="Interface detail" src={imgInterfaceMore} />

## Network

Network displays devices discovered on your local network.

<img width="320" alt="Networks list" src={imgNetworks} />

Tap a device to inspect details and activity.

<img width="320" alt="Network device" src={imgNetworkDevice} />

Use this view to identify unknown devices or confirm network visibility.

---

## Common real-world scenarios

- **A device behaves differently from others**
  Use **Groups & Clients** to confirm the client identity and adjust
  its group assignment.

- **Too many false positives after adding a list**
  Open **Adlists**, temporarily disable the list, and update gravity
  to confirm the impact.

- **DNS responses look incorrect or stale**
  Use **Restart DNS resolver** from Advanced Setup to refresh the service.

- **Network layout changed**
  Flush the network table so Pi-hole can rebuild device mappings.

## Important notes and limits

Server Settings always apply to the **currently selected Pi-hole server**.
If multiple servers are configured in the app, double-check Server Info
before making changes.

Some features are available only on **Pi-hole v6**.
If an option does not appear, this usually reflects the server’s version
or configuration rather than an app error.

Certain actions, such as restarting DNS or flushing logs,
may briefly affect DNS service or remove diagnostic data.
Avoid using them during peak usage or active investigations.

## Pi-hole concepts used on this screen

A **server setting** changes how Pi-hole processes DNS requests
for all connected clients.

- **Adlists** define which external blocklists are used
- **Groups** control which policies apply to which clients
- **Gravity** is the compiled blocking database built from adlists
- **FTL** is Pi-hole’s DNS engine responsible for query handling

Understanding these concepts helps ensure that server-level changes
are intentional, traceable, and reversible when needed.
