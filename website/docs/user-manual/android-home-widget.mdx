# 🧩 Android Home Widget

## Overview

The Android Home Widget lets you control and monitor Pi-hole Client **without opening the app**.
It is designed for quick checks and quick actions from your Home screen.

Use it when you want to:

- Confirm whether blocking is currently ON or OFF
- Toggle blocking quickly when something breaks
- Glance at key statistics at any time

  <img width="240" alt="All widgets with blocking enabled" src={imageWidgetOn} />
</ImageRow>

## What you can do with the widget

- **Check status**: see whether Pi-hole is blocking, offline, or needs attention
- **Blocking ON / OFF**: toggle blocking from the shield button
- **View statistics**: confirm Total / Blocked / % / Domains at a glance
- **Manual refresh**: update the widget when the information looks outdated

## Adding the widget to your Home screen

The exact steps vary slightly by device, but the general flow is the same:

1. Long-press an empty area on your Home screen.
2. Tap **Widgets**.
3. Find **Pi-hole Client** in the widget list.
4. Drag **Pi-hole Home Widget** onto your Home screen.

### First time setup: select a server

When you add the widget for the first time, you must select **which server** the widget controls.
After selection, the widget is created and starts showing data for that server.

If a server is shown as unavailable, it means the widget cannot work with that server version.
In that case, select a different server or use the in-app Home screen instead.

If the server selection screen shows an empty list, open the app once and confirm you have at least
one server configured.

## Widget layout and elements

The widget is built around “read first, then act”.
Start by checking the server name and the status, then decide whether to refresh or toggle blocking.

### Server name

Shows which Pi-hole server this widget is connected to.
This is important if you manage multiple Pi-hole instances.

### Status (Blocking ON / OFF / Error / Auth required)

The widget shows its status through the **shield icon** and whether actions are enabled.
Use it to decide whether you can toggle right now or should open the app first.

- **Blocking ON**: Pi-hole is active and filtering queries
- **Blocking OFF**: filtering is paused/disabled
- **Error**: the widget cannot update (for example, offline or server unreachable)
- **Auth required**: the widget needs you to open the app before it can refresh again

### Statistics (Total / Blocked / % / Domains)

These values help you understand current activity at a glance:

- **Total**: total DNS queries handled
- **Blocked**: queries blocked by Pi-hole
- **Blocked %**: percentage of blocked queries
- **Domains**: domains on adlists (the size of your blocklists)

### Updated time

Shows when the widget last refreshed.
Use this to judge whether the displayed data is still current enough for your situation.

### Toggle button (Shield)

When available, tap the shield to toggle blocking ON / OFF for the widget's selected server.
If the widget shows **Error** or **Auth required**, toggling is disabled.

### Refresh button

On medium and larger widget sizes, a refresh icon appears next to the shield.
Use it when you need the latest state immediately.

## Widget sizes and behavior

The widget comes in three sizes to fit your Home screen:

### Stats (Large)

The most detailed view with full statistics, server name, and all actions visible.

### Compact (Medium)

A balanced view showing key stats and toggle/refresh actions in a smaller footprint.

<img width="280" alt="Compact widget (medium)" src={imageWidgetMedium} />

### Toggle (Small)

Minimal widget focused on the toggle action. Shows status and blocking control only.

<img width="128" alt="Toggle widget (small)" src={imageWidgetSmall} />

## Updating and refresh behavior

Widgets refresh more conservatively than in-app screens.
This is normal and helps reduce battery usage.

- **Automatic refresh**: due to Android OS limitations, the widget updates approximately every **30 minutes** in the background
- **Manual refresh**: use the refresh action when you need the latest state right now

If your device is in battery saver mode or background activity is restricted,
updates may be less frequent.

---

## Tips and limitations

- **Offline or unreachable server**: the widget may show **Error** and stop updating until connectivity returns
- **Server Compatibility**: the widget currently supports **Pi-hole v6** servers; Pi-hole v5 servers may not be selectable
- **What the widget cannot do**: advanced settings, detailed logs, and list management still require opening the app
