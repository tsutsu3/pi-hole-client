# 🏠 Home

## What you can do on this screen

The Home screen is the control center of Pi-hole Client.
You mainly use it to:

- Check whether Pi-hole is currently blocking traffic
- Temporarily pause or resume blocking when something breaks
- Jump directly to detailed views such as Logs or Adlists

Open this screen first when ads suddenly appear or when you want to confirm
that you are connected to the correct server.

---

## Start by confirming the server and its state

When Home opens, do not tap anything yet.
First, look at the **top area of the screen**.

You will see the currently selected server name and a shield status icon.
This area tells you **which server you are controlling** and **whether it is
ready to accept actions**.

<ImageRow>
  <img width="240" alt="Home top area with server name and summary tiles" src={imgHomeTop} />
  <img width="240" alt="Home bottom area" src={imgHomeBottom} />
</ImageRow>

The shield icon represents the current state:

- **Green shield with a check**:
  Blocking is enabled and Pi-hole is actively filtering queries.
- **Red shield with a cross**:
  Blocking is **disabled** and all DNS queries are allowed.
- **Orange shield with an exclamation mark**:
  The app cannot communicate with the server.
- **Gray shield outline**:
  The app is still connecting or loading data.

<img width="320" alt="Home status icon legend" src={imgHomeStatusIcon} />

This icon is **not tappable**.
Use it to decide what to do next: wait, reconnect, switch servers, or toggle
blocking.

If the icon is gray or orange, avoid making changes until the connection
stabilizes.

## Quick actions from the menu

Tap the three-dot icon in the top-right corner to open quick actions.

<img width="320" alt="Home menu actions" src={imgHomeMenu} />

Depending on the current state, you may see:

- **Refresh** - reload server status and statistics
- **Open Web Panel** - open the Pi-hole admin interface in a browser
- **Change Server** - switch to another configured server

Use this menu when the displayed data looks outdated or when you need to access
the full web interface for advanced configuration.

Note: *Open Web Panel* assumes the admin interface is available at `/admin/`.
If your Pi-hole uses a custom path, open it manually in a browser.

## Switching the active server

Next to the server name, you see a **⇄ icon**.
This indicates that server switching is available.

Tap the server name area to open the server switch dialog.

<img width="320" alt="Server selection screen" src={imgHomeServerSelect} />

In this dialog, you can:

- View all configured Pi-hole servers
- See which server is currently active
- Tap another server to switch immediately

After selecting a server, Home reloads automatically.
All statistics, status icons, and actions now refer to the newly selected server.

Use this feature when you manage multiple Pi-hole instances
(for example, a home server and a remote server).

Always confirm the server name again after switching.
Actions such as pausing blocking apply **only to the currently selected server**.

## Using summary tiles to jump to details

Below the top status area, you see four summary tiles showing live statistics.

Each tile is tappable and works as a shortcut:

<img width="320" alt="Home summary tiles" src={imgHomeTiles} />

- **Total Queries**
  Opens Network (showing all devices).
- **Queries Blocked**
  Opens Logs with blocked queries in focus.
- **Percentage Blocked**
  Opens Logs with the status filter reset to show all queries.
- **Domains on Adlists**
  Opens the adlist (subscription) view in Server Settings.

Use these tiles when you already know what you want to inspect and want to
skip manual navigation through Settings.

While data is loading, skeleton placeholders appear.
This means the server connection is active but the data is not ready yet.

## Controlling blocking with the floating shield button

The floating shield button in the bottom-right corner is the fastest way to
control blocking.

<img width="320" alt="Home floating shield button" src={imgHomeFab} />

- When blocking is **ON**, tapping the button opens a pause dialog
- Choose a duration (for example, 5 minutes)
- Blocking automatically resumes after the selected time

If blocking is already **OFF**, tapping the button resumes it immediately.

The button hides while you scroll down and reappears when you scroll up.
It is also hidden while the screen is still loading.

Use this control only for short troubleshooting.
Leaving blocking disabled for long periods reduces the effectiveness of Pi-hole.

## Typical operation: pause blocking briefly

1. Open **Home**
2. Confirm the shield icon is green
3. Tap the floating shield button
4. Select **5 minutes**
5. Blocking pauses and resumes automatically

This flow is designed to be quick and reversible without opening Settings.

## Common real-world scenarios

- **Ads suddenly appear**
  Open Home, check the shield icon, and resume blocking if it is red.

- **A website or app fails to load**
  Pause blocking for a short time, test again, and let blocking resume
  automatically.

- **Investigating blocked traffic**
  Tap *Queries Blocked* to jump directly to Logs with the relevant filter applied.

## Important notes and limits

If no server is selected, Home shows almost no data and most actions are disabled.
Connection errors appear as an orange shield, and blocking controls will not work.
Some shortcuts depend on Pi-hole v6 features and may not exist on older versions.

## Pi-hole concepts used on this screen

A **query** is a DNS request handled by Pi-hole.
A **blocked** query means Pi-hole returned a blocking response instead of an IP
address.
Pausing blocking temporarily disables filtering at the Pi-hole core level.
