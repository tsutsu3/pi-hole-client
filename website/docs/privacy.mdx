# üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the [Pi-hole client](https://github.com/tsutsu3/pi-hole-client)
app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created
by [tsutsu3](https://github.com/tsutsu3) as a Free service. This service is
intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information **only in the event of an error** to help
developers identify and fix issues.

By **default**, error logging is **disabled**, and users must manually enable
it in the settings if they wish to participate.

The collected information includes the following:

### Automatically Collected Information During Errors

#### User Information

- IP address (used for error diagnostics and approximate geolocation, such as
country and city)

#### Device Information

- OS name, version, and kernel
- Brand and model name
- Processor architecture
- Accessibility settings
- Language
- Device ID (unique to the device, not the user)
- Model ID (identical for all devices of the same model)
- Free and total memory
- Free and total storage
- Charging status
- Screen resolution, density, orientation, and DPI
- Processor cores and frequency
- Timezone

#### Application Information

- Installation source
- Version
- Error stack trace

### NOT captured

Under **NO CIRCUMSTANCE** will Application capture or store sensitive user
information such as:

- Precise geolocation (exact GPS coordinates are not collected; only approximate
location based on IP address may be inferred)
- Email addresses
- Usernames or passwords
- Carrier information
- Phone numbers
- Installed apps
- Any other data that could identify or track a user on the Internet or create
a virtual profile of an individual or group.

## Error Logging

The Application uses an error logging system to send diagnostic information to
a server when an error occurs.
This information is:

- Aggregated and anonymized to protect user privacy.
- Used exclusively to identify and fix issues in the Application.
- Deleted once it is no longer necessary.

The Service Provider ensures that no personal information, such as emails,
usernames, or passwords, is included in the collected data.

### Opt-Out of Error Logging

By default, the Application **does not send any error logs.** Users must
explicitly enable error reporting in the Application settings if they wish to
contribute error logs.

If error logging is enabled, users can disable it at any time in the settings
menu.

## Additional Notes

This policy ensures that all collected data is anonymized and used solely for
debugging purposes.
Once the data is no longer needed, it will be permanently deleted to protect
 user privacy.

## Third Party Access

The Application utilizes third-party services to assist in error logging and
analysis. These services may receive anonymized data in compliance with their
privacy policies:

- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/privacy/): Collects diagnostic information such as
error stack traces, device details, and approximate location based on IP
address (e.g., country and city).

The Service Provider may disclose collected information in the following
circumstances:

- To comply with legal obligations (e.g., subpoenas or government requests).
- To protect the rights and safety of users or others.
- To trusted service providers who adhere to this privacy policy and act on
behalf of the Service Provider.

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all information collection by uninstalling the Application.
Use the standard uninstall procedures available on your mobile device or app
marketplace.

Additionally, you may disable error logging in the Application settings if it
has been enabled.

## Data Retention Policy

Information collected during errors is retained only as long as necessary to
resolve the issue. Once the data is no longer needed, it is permanently deleted.
If you'd like to request the deletion of collected data, please contact us at
[tsutsu3](mailto:tsutsu3prog@gmail.com).
We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible.

## Children

The Application is not intended for children under the age of 13.
The Service Provider does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
If such data is discovered, it will be promptly deleted. Parents or guardians
can contact the Service Provider to request data removal.

## Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of
your information.
The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards
to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by
updating this page with the new Privacy Policy.
You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as
continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of **2025-10-15**
