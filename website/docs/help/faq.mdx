### 💡 Answer

On certain devices, the app may occasionally fail to connect to your Pi-hole
server during automatic refresh.
This can happen when the refresh timing aligns poorly with how long the server
keeps connections open.

### 🛠 Temporary Workaround

**Try adjusting the auto-refresh interval in the app settings.**

Using exact round numbers like **"5 seconds" (5000 ms)** may increase the chance
of connection issues.
Shifting the interval slightly **up or down** can help avoid this.

#### ❌ Avoid

* 5 seconds (5000 ms)

#### ✅ Recommended

* 4 seconds (4000 ms)
* 6 seconds (6000 ms)

> Since version 1.5.0, the app automatically adds a small buffer to avoid this
> issue, but manual adjustment may still help in some cases.
