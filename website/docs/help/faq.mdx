# 🤔 FAQ

## ❓ Q1. The app frequently disconnects or fails to fetch status

### 💡 Answer

On certain devices, the app may occasionally fail to connect to your Pi-hole
server during automatic refresh.
This can happen when the refresh timing aligns poorly with how long the server
keeps connections open.

### 🛠 Temporary Workaround

**Try adjusting the auto-refresh interval in the app settings.**

Using exact round numbers like **"5 seconds" (5000 ms)** may increase the chance
of connection issues.
Shifting the interval slightly **up or down** can help avoid this.

#### ❌ Avoid

- 5 seconds (5000 ms)

#### ✅ Recommended

- 4 seconds (4000 ms)
- 6 seconds (6000 ms)

> Since version 1.5.0, the app automatically adds a small buffer to avoid this
> issue, but manual adjustment may still help in some cases.

## ❓ Q2. "Connection failed" with self-signed certificate

### 💡 Answer

1. Check if **"Allow self-signed certificates"** is enabled in server settings
2. If using Docker, try enabling **"Don't check SSL certificate"**
3. Verify the server URL is correct

For more details, see the [Certificate Configuration Guide](../../guides/cert-config).

## ❓ Q3. Certificate pin mismatch after server certificate update

### 💡 Answer

If you renewed or regenerated your server's certificate, the app will detect that the fingerprint no longer matches and block the connection.

**To fix this:**

1. Go to server settings
2. Open the server menu and select **"Update"**

<img width="320" alt="Server menu with Update option" src={imgServerMenu} />

3. Verify the new fingerprint is legitimate and tap **"Update"**

<img width="320" alt="Update pinned fingerprint dialog" src={imgCertUpdate} />

4. The server will now show "HTTPS Pinned" status with the new fingerprint

:::danger
If you didn't change your certificate, this could indicate a security issue.
Verify your server's certificate before updating the pin.

## ❓ Q4. Warning banner about unverified certificates keeps appearing

### 💡 Answer

The warning banner appears when you have servers with **"HTTPS Untrusted Allowed"** status.

**To resolve this:**

1. **Pin the certificate** for those servers (recommended) - tap on the server to trigger the pinning flow
2. Or tap **"Dismiss"** on the banner (not recommended as it reduces security awareness)

For more details, see the [Certificate Configuration Guide](../../guides/cert-config).
