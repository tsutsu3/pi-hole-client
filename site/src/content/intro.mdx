# üß© Introduction

**Pi-hole Client** is an unofficial Android app for monitoring and managing
your own Pi-hole from your phone. It puts everyday admin tasks‚Äîchecking stats,
pausing protection, browsing recent queries, and editing lists‚Äîinto a fast,
mobile-first experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Not affiliated with the Pi-hole team. The app talks **directly** to your
> Pi-hole; there‚Äôs no relay or third-party server.

## ‚úÖ Supported versions

- **Pi-hole v6** ‚Äî fully supported
- **Pi-hole v5** ‚Äî supported as legacy

## üè† Access model (LAN-first)

This app is designed for **local network use**. In normal operation you use it **only on your LAN** (home Wi-Fi). We do **not** recommend exposing Pi-hole to the public Internet.

- Connect when your phone and Pi-hole are on the **same LAN/VPN**.
- **No port forwarding** needed.
- Use the Pi-hole **IP** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.2/`) or a resolvable hostname.
- If you must use it away from home, prefer a **VPN** (WireGuard/Tailscale). For HTTPS, use a trusted certificate.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìä Dashboard: queries today, blocked %, top domains/clients
- ‚èØÔ∏è One-tap pause/resume (with timers)
- üîé Query log with rich filtering
- ‚úÖ/üö´ Allow/Block lists; update Adlists and apply changes
- üñ•Ô∏è Multiple servers with quick switching
- üîê HTTP/HTTPS (use HTTPS outside LAN)
- üé® Material You theming (Android 12+)

## üß∞ Requirements

- A reachable **Pi-hole v6 or v5** instance (same LAN, VPN, or a securely exposed endpoint)

## üöÄ Quick start

3. **Verify** the dashboard loads; try a 10-second pause to confirm control.

> [!TIP]
>
> If the Pi-hole Web UI opens in your phone‚Äôs browser at an address, the app should work with the same address.

## üîí Privacy & crash reporting

- **Sentry reports are sent only when BOTH are true:**
  1. **Send diagnostics** is **ON**, **and**
  2. a **bug/crash** occurs.
- Sent: stack trace, app/OS version, device model, and minimal context.
